This was my first attempt at using RealityScan to create a 3D scan of an object. The mobile app determines the position and shape of the object by continuously capturing photos. I scanned a small metal cherry. I took over 200 photos while circling around this tiny object. After loading for more than ten minutes, the app generated a 3D model, but I noticed some issues. The surface of the cherry was not smooth, the leaf part had some dents, and there was no bottom surface. Overall, the model turned out rather rough.
第一次尝试使用realityscan进行3D扫描物体，这款手机软件是根据连续拍摄照片来判断物体的位置和造型。我拍摄了一个金属小樱桃。我围绕着这个小物品疯狂进行拍照，拍了两百多张照片。加载了十几分钟后，生成了一个3D模型，但发现了一些问题。樱桃表面并不光滑，叶子部分有凹陷，并且没有底面，这个模型比较粗糙。

I think perhaps improving photography skills can enhance the accuracy of the model. When taking photos around an object, the object should be centered in the viewfinder, and only part of the object should not be visible, as this can severely impact the scanning accuracy.
我觉得或许提升拍照的技术，可以提高模型的精度。围绕物体进行拍照时，物体应在取景框中间，不能只出现部分物体，这样会严重影响扫描的准确度。
